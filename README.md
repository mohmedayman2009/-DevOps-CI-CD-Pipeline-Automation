# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Automation

This repository contains a simple DevOps project that demonstrates the use of various DevOps tools and technologies to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of various DevOps tools and technologies to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. It includes the integration of tools like Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of how these tools can work together in a CI/CD pipeline. It serves as a learning resource for those interested in DevOps practices and tooling.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based EC2 instance for hosting Jenkins.
- Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes installed on separate EC2 instances.
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD principles and Java application development.


## Tools and Technologies

The project uses the following tools and technologies:

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control system.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **Jenkins**: Continuous integration/continuous delivery tool.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management and application-deployment tool.
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
- `Docker/`: Contain Dockerfiles.
- `ansible/`: Contains Ansible playbooks for automating various tasks.
- `kubernetes/`: Contains Kubernetes configuration files for deploying the application and its services.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation and setup guides.

## Usage
After setting up the CI/CD pipeline, you can automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your Java applications. The pipeline facilitates continuous integration and deployment, ensuring a smooth and efficient development workflow.
