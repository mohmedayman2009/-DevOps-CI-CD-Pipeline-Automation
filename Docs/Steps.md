## Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Jenkins Server
- **Setup a Linux EC2 instance**: Launch an EC2 instance with a Linux distribution of your choice, which will host Jenkins.
- **Installation of Jenkins**: Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance. Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software.
- **Installation of Java**: Since Jenkins is a Java-based application, install Java on the EC2 instance.
- **Jenkins Start**: Start the Jenkins service and ensure it's running properly.
- **Access Web UI on port 8080**: Access the Jenkins web interface by navigating to the EC2 instance's IP address followed by `:8080`.

### 2. Running the First Jenkins Job
- **Integrate Git with Jenkins**: Configure Jenkins to work with Git, allowing it to pull code from repositories.
- **Install Git on Jenkins Instances**: Ensure Git is installed on the Jenkins server.
- **Install GitHub plugin on Jenkins GUI**: Add the GitHub plugin through the Jenkins GUI to integrate GitHub with Jenkins.
- **Configure Git on Jenkins GUI**: Set up Git settings in Jenkins to connect with your Git repositories.
- **Run Jenkins Job to pull code from GitHub**: Create a job in Jenkins to pull the latest code from a GitHub repository.

### 3. Integrating Maven with Jenkins
- **Setup Maven on Jenkins Server**: Install and configure Maven, which is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.
- **Install Maven Plugin**: Add the Maven plugin in Jenkins to support Maven projects.
- **Configure Maven and Java**: Set up the correct paths and environment variables for Maven and Java on Jenkins.
- **Build a Java project using Jenkins and generate artifacts**: Create a Jenkins job to build a Java project and produce build artifacts like JARs or WARs.

### 4. Integrating Tomcat in CI/CD Pipeline
- **Setup a Linux EC2 Instance**: Similar to the Jenkins server, set up another EC2 instance for Tomcat.
- **Install Java**: Install Java on the new EC2 instance as Tomcat is a Java-based application server.
- **Configure Tomcat**: Set up and configure the Tomcat server.
- **Start Tomcat Server**: Start the Tomcat service.
- **Access Web UI on port 8080**: Access the Tomcat web interface using the instance's IP address and port `8080`.
- **Edit Manage App Error**: Resolve any errors related to application management in Tomcat.
- **Create Tomcat Users**: Set up user accounts for managing Tomcat.
- **Tomcat Start and Shutdown**: Learn how to start and stop the Tomcat server.
- **Install Tomcat with Jenkins**: Integrate Tomcat with Jenkins to enable continuous deployment.
- **Install plugin “deploy to container”**: Add the "deploy to container" plugin in Jenkins to facilitate deployment to Tomcat.
- **Build Maven and Deploy to Tomcat Server**: Configure Jenkins to build the Maven project and deploy the artifacts to the Tomcat server.
- **Deploy Artifacts on Tomcat Server - Using Git Bash**: Use Git Bash to deploy build artifacts onto the Tomcat server.
- **Automate Build and Deploy using poll SCM**: Set up Jenkins to periodically check the source code management system and automatically build and deploy changes.

### 5. Integrating Docker in CI/CD Pipeline
- **Setup a Docker Environment**: Prepare an environment suitable for Docker on an EC2 instance.
- **Install Docker**: Install Docker to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
- **Start docker services**: Ensure the Docker service is started and functioning correctly.
- **Create a Tomcat Container**: Use Docker to create a container that runs Tomcat.
- **Creating Images**: Build Docker images that will be used to create containers.
- **Creating Container**: Use the Docker images to create new containers for your applications.
- **Fixing Tomcat Container Issue**: Address any issues that arise with the Tomcat container.
- **Create a Docker File**: Write a Dockerfile to automate the creation of Docker images.
- **Integrate Docker with Jenkins**: Configure Jenkins to work with Docker, allowing for container management within the CI/CD pipeline.

### 6. Integrating Ansible in CI/CD Pipeline
- **Prepare Ansible Server**: Set up an EC2 instance to serve as the Ansible control node.
- **Setup hostname**: Assign a hostname to the Ansible server for easy identification.
- **Create ansadmin users**: Create a user named 'ansadmin' on the Ansible server.
- **Add Users to sudoers file**: Grant 'ansadmin' sudo privileges by editing the sudoers file.
- **Configuring SSH**: Set up SSH to allow secure remote management of servers.
- **Enable Password Based Login**: Configure the server to allow password-based SSH login.
- **Generated SSH Keys**: Generate SSH keys for secure authentication without passwords.
- **Install Ansible**: Install Ansible on the server to automate tasks across multiple hosts.

### 7. Integrating Kubernetes in CI/CD Pipeline
- **Kubernetes installation**: Install Kubernetes, which is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
- **EKS installation procedure**: Follow the procedure to install Amazon EKS, which is a managed Kubernetes service.
- **Kubernetes Setup using eksctl**: Use 'eksctl' to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on EKS.
- **Pre-requisites**: Ensure all necessary tools and permissions are in place before setting up Kubernetes.
- **Create your cluster and nodes**: Use 'eksctl' or other tools to create a Kubernetes cluster and its nodes.
- **Validate your cluster**: Test the cluster by checking nodes and creating a pod.
- **Integrating Kubernetes in CI/CD pipeline**: Configure Jenkins to work with Kubernetes, enabling automated deployment to Kubernetes clusters.
